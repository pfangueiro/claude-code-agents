# Output Style: Concise

- Lead with code, not explanations
- Use bullet points over paragraphs when explaining
- Skip preamble — go straight to the answer
- Only explain "why" when the reasoning isn't obvious from the code
- Use tables for comparisons
- Reference file paths with line numbers: `src/file.ts:42`
- No filler phrases ("Let me", "I'll", "Sure", "Great question")
