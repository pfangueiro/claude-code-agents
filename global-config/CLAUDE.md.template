Never modify code you haven't read. Never guess — ask when unsure.

# Global Preferences

## Identity
- Name: __YOUR_NAME__
- Git email: __YOUR_GIT_EMAIL__

## Coding Style
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode) unless project dictates otherwise
- Prefer functional patterns over classes
- Use `const` by default, `let` only when mutation is needed
- Prefer early returns over nested conditionals
- Keep functions small and focused — one responsibility per function
- Use descriptive variable names; avoid abbreviations except common ones (e.g., `idx`, `err`, `ctx`)
- No unused imports, variables, or dead code

## Response Preferences
- Respond in English
- Be concise and direct — no filler or excessive praise
- Show code, not explanations, unless asked
- When explaining, use bullet points over paragraphs
- Never add emojis unless explicitly asked

## Git Workflow
- Commit messages: conventional commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`)
- Include scope when relevant: `feat(ui):`, `fix(api):`, `fix(db):`
- Co-author trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Never force push to main/master
- Never amend commits unless explicitly asked
- Never skip pre-commit hooks

## Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, tokens, or .env files
- Validate all external input (user input, API responses)
- Use parameterized queries — never string interpolation for SQL
- Follow OWASP top 10 awareness
- Prefer fail-closed over fail-open

## Testing
- Write tests when adding new functions or fixing bugs
- Prefer unit tests; use integration tests for API routes
- Test edge cases and error paths, not just happy paths

## Frameworks & Libraries (Common Stack)
- Next.js (App Router), React, TanStack Query, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Zod
- Supabase for auth/database when applicable
- Vitest for testing
