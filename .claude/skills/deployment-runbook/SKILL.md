# Deployment Runbook

## Overview

This skill provides deployment procedures, automated health checks, and rollback strategies to ensure safe, reliable deployments. Use it to standardize deployment workflows and reduce deployment-related incidents.

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning production deployments
- Executing staged rollouts (canary, blue-green)
- Performing post-deployment health checks
- Rolling back failed deployments
- Troubleshooting deployment issues
- Establishing deployment best practices
- Complementing the **devops-automation agent** for deployments

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment

**Best for**: Zero-downtime deployments, easy rollbacks

**Process:**
1. Deploy to inactive (green) environment
2. Run health checks on green
3. Switch traffic from blue to green
4. Monitor for issues
5. Keep blue as instant rollback option

**Commands:**
```bash
# Deploy to green environment
./deploy.sh --env green

# Run health checks
python3 scripts/health_check.py --env green

# Switch traffic (gradual)
./switch_traffic.sh --from blue --to green --percentage 10
./switch_traffic.sh --from blue --to green --percentage 50
./switch_traffic.sh --from blue --to green --percentage 100

# If issues: instant rollback
./switch_traffic.sh --from green --to blue --percentage 100
```

### 2. Canary Deployment

**Best for**: Risk-averse deployments, gradual rollouts

**Process:**
1. Deploy to small subset of servers (5-10%)
2. Monitor metrics closely
3. Gradually increase percentage
4. Roll back if metrics degrade

**Monitoring During Canary:**
- Error rate < baseline + 1%
- Response time < baseline + 10%
- Success rate > 99.9%

### 3. Rolling Deployment

**Best for**: Standard updates, resource-constrained environments

**Process:**
1. Take one instance out of load balancer
2. Deploy new version
3. Run health checks
4. Add back to load balancer
5. Repeat for remaining instances

## Deployment Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (T-30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Verify staging environment
./verify_staging.sh

# 2. Create deployment tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release 1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3

# 3. Trigger production build
./build_production.sh --tag v1.2.3

# 4. Backup database
./backup_db.sh --environment production

# 5. Notify team
./notify_slack.sh "üöÄ Starting deployment v1.2.3 in 30 minutes"
```

### Phase 2: Deployment (T-0)

```bash
# 1. Enable maintenance mode (if needed)
./maintenance_mode.sh --enable

# 2. Run database migrations
./run_migrations.sh --environment production

# 3. Deploy application
./deploy.sh --environment production --version v1.2.3

# 4. Disable maintenance mode
./maintenance_mode.sh --disable
```

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Health Checks

```bash
# Run comprehensive health checks
python3 scripts/health_check.py --environment production

# Expected output:
# ‚úì API health endpoint responding
# ‚úì Database connectivity OK
# ‚úì Cache layer accessible
# ‚úì External services reachable
# ‚úì Error rate within threshold
# ‚úì Response time within SLA
```

### Phase 4: Monitoring (T+30 minutes)

Monitor these metrics:

**Application Metrics:**
- Error rate: < 0.1%
- Response time (p95): < 200ms
- Request throughput: within expected range
- Success rate: > 99.9%

**Infrastructure Metrics:**
- CPU utilization: < 70%
- Memory usage: < 80%
- Disk I/O: normal patterns
- Network latency: < 50ms

**Business Metrics:**
- Conversion rate: no significant drop
- User signups: within expected range
- Transaction volume: normal patterns

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

Rollback immediately if:
- Error rate > 1%
- Critical functionality broken
- Data corruption detected
- Security vulnerability introduced
- Performance degradation > 50%

### Rollback Methods

#### Method 1: Traffic Switch (Fastest)

```bash
# Blue-green: instant rollback
./switch_traffic.sh --from green --to blue --percentage 100

# Verification
python3 scripts/health_check.py --environment production
```

#### Method 2: Version Revert

```bash
# Deploy previous version
./deploy.sh --environment production --version v1.2.2

# Run health checks
python3 scripts/health_check.py --environment production
```

#### Method 3: Database Rollback

```bash
# If migrations were applied
./rollback_migration.sh --environment production --steps 1

# Restore from backup (last resort)
./restore_db.sh --backup latest --environment production
```

### Post-Rollback

1. **Verify system health**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/health_check.py --environment production
   ```

2. **Notify stakeholders**
   ```bash
   ./notify_slack.sh "‚ö†Ô∏è Deployment v1.2.3 rolled back. System stable on v1.2.2"
   ```

3. **Create postmortem**
   - What went wrong?
   - Why didn't we catch it?
   - How do we prevent recurrence?

## Health Check Script

Use the included health check script:

```bash
# Run all checks
python3 scripts/health_check.py --env production

# Run specific check
python3 scripts/health_check.py --env production --check api

# Verbose output
python3 scripts/health_check.py --env production --verbose
```

See `scripts/health_check.py` for implementation.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Deployment Hangs

**Symptoms:**
- Deployment script doesn't complete
- Services not starting

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check service logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/app-name

# Check events
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

**Resolution:**
- Increase timeout values
- Check resource constraints
- Verify image pull secrets

### Issue: High Error Rate Post-Deployment

**Symptoms:**
- Error rate spike
- 500 errors in logs

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check application logs
tail -f /var/log/app/error.log

# Check error distribution
grep "ERROR" /var/log/app/* | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

**Resolution:**
- Check configuration changes
- Verify environment variables
- Review recent code changes
- Consider immediate rollback

### Issue: Database Connection Failures

**Symptoms:**
- "Connection refused" errors
- Timeout errors

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Test database connectivity
python3 scripts/test_db_connection.py

# Check connection pool
psql -h db-host -U user -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"
```

**Resolution:**
- Verify connection strings
- Check firewall rules
- Increase connection pool size
- Verify credentials

6. **Test rollback procedure** in staging first
7. **Use feature flags** for risky changes
8. **Automate health checks** (don't rely on manual verification)

```bash
./switch_traffic.sh --from green --to blue --percentage 100
