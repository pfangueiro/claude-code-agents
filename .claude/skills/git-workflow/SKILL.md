# Git Workflow

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive git workflow best practices, branching strategies, and collaboration patterns. Use it to ensure consistent, professional git usage across your projects.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating commits with proper messages
- Establishing branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based)
- Handling pull requests and code reviews
- Managing releases and hotfixes
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Setting up git hooks and automation

## Core Workflows

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the Conventional Commits specification for clear, semantic commit messages:

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, tooling
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh mechanism

Implement automatic token refresh before expiration.
Tokens are refreshed 5 minutes before expiry.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(api): handle null responses in user service

Add defensive null checks to prevent NPE when
external API returns unexpected null values.

Fixes #456
```

### Branching Strategies

#### Git Flow (Traditional)
Best for: Scheduled releases, multiple version support

**Branches:**
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: New features
- `release/*`: Release preparation
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency production fixes

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Finish feature
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication
git branch -d feature/user-authentication

# Create release
git checkout -b release/1.2.0
# Bump version, final testing
git checkout main
git merge release/1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release 1.2.0"
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.2.0
```

#### GitHub Flow (Simplified)
Best for: Continuous deployment, web applications

**Branches:**
- `main`: Always deployable
- `feature/*`: All changes

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Start work
git checkout -b feature/add-dark-mode

# Make changes, commit often
git commit -m "feat(ui): add dark mode toggle"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/add-dark-mode
# Create pull request on GitHub
# After review and CI passes, merge to main
# Deploy from main
```

#### Trunk-Based Development
Best for: High-frequency releases, mature CI/CD

**Key principles:**
- All work on `main` or very short-lived feature branches (<1 day)
- Feature flags for incomplete features
- Rigorous automated testing

### Pull Request Best Practices

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix
- [ ] New feature
- [ ] Breaking change
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing Done
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Screenshots (if applicable)

## Related Issues
Closes #123
```

**Review Checklist:**
1. Code follows project conventions
2. Tests cover new functionality
3. Documentation is updated
4. No sensitive data committed
5. CI/CD pipeline passes
6. Performance impact considered

### Handling Merge Conflicts

**Process:**
```bash
# Update your branch with latest main
git checkout feature/my-feature
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# If conflicts occur
# 1. Open conflicted files
# 2. Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>
# 3. Resolve manually, keeping appropriate changes
# 4. Remove conflict markers
# 5. Test the resolved code
git add <resolved-files>
git commit -m "chore: resolve merge conflicts with main"
```

**Conflict Resolution Tips:**
- Communicate with the other developer if unsure
- Prefer rebasing for cleaner history (if branch not shared)
- Use `git mergetool` for complex conflicts
- Always test after resolution

### Git Hooks and Automation

Common hooks to consider:

**pre-commit:**
```bash
# Run linters, formatters
npm run lint
npm run format

# Run fast tests
npm run test:unit
```

**commit-msg:**
```bash
# Validate commit message format
# Ensure conventional commits compliance
```

**pre-push:**
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm run test

# Run build
npm run build
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Rebasing vs Merging

**Use Rebase When:**
- Working on personal feature branch
- Want linear history
- Need to incorporate upstream changes

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

**Use Merge When:**
- Working on shared branches
- Want to preserve complete history
- Merging pull requests

```bash
git merge origin/main
```

### Cherry-Picking

Use to apply specific commits to another branch:

```bash
# Find commit hash
git log

# Apply to current branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Interactive Rebase

Clean up commit history before pushing:

```bash
# Rebase last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Options: pick, reword, squash, fixup, drop
```

## Common Scenarios

### Undo Last Commit (Not Pushed)
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Keep changes staged
git reset HEAD~1         # Keep changes unstaged
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Discard changes
```

### Undo Pushed Commit
```bash
# Create new commit that reverses changes
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### Stash Changes
```bash
# Save work in progress
git stash save "WIP: feature description"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply stash
git stash apply stash@{0}

# Apply and remove
git stash pop
```

### Update Commit Message
```bash
# Last commit (not pushed)
git commit --amend -m "new message"

# Older commit
git rebase -i HEAD~n  # Use 'reword'
```

## Quick Reference

**Daily Commands:**
```bash
git status                    # Check status
git add <file>               # Stage file
git commit -m "message"      # Commit with message
git push origin <branch>     # Push to remote
git pull origin <branch>     # Pull from remote
git checkout -b <branch>     # Create and switch branch
git merge <branch>           # Merge branch
```

**Inspection:**
```bash
git log --oneline --graph    # Visual commit history
git diff                     # See unstaged changes
git diff --staged            # See staged changes
git show <commit>            # Show commit details
git blame <file>             # See who changed each line
```

**Cleanup:**
```bash
git branch -d <branch>       # Delete local branch
git push origin :<branch>    # Delete remote branch
git clean -fd                # Remove untracked files
git gc                       # Garbage collection
```
