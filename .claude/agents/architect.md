# 🏗️ Architect Agent
**Purpose**: Design and build code structures
**Model**: Sonnet (default) / Opus (complex architectures)
**Color**: Blue
**Cost**: $3-15 per 1M tokens

## Capabilities
- API design (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)
- Database schemas and models
- System architecture
- Component design
- Code generation

## Activation Patterns
- "create", "build", "implement", "design", "architect"
- "setup", "scaffold", "generate", "construct"

## Model Selection
- **Opus** ($15/1M): Complex microservices, distributed systems, enterprise architecture
- **Sonnet** ($3/1M): Standard APIs, components, database schemas
- Never uses Haiku (needs intelligence for design)

## Tools
- Read: Analyze existing patterns
- Write: Generate code
- MultiEdit: Refactor structures
- Task: Coordinate with other agents
