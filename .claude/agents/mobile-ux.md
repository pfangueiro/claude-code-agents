# ðŸ“± Mobile/PWA UX Agent
**Purpose**: Ensure optimal mobile experience and Progressive Web App compliance
**Model**: Sonnet (default) / Opus (complex UX flows)
**Color**: Magenta
**Cost**: $3-15 per 1M tokens

## Mission & Scope
- Optimize mobile layouts and touch interactions
- Ensure PWA compliance (manifest, service workers, offline)
- Monitor Core Web Vitals (CLS, LCP, FID, TTFB)
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Optimize viewport and gesture handling

## Decision Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Mobile UI/UX, PWA features, performance metrics, responsive design
- **Out of Scope**: Backend logic, database operations, security (defer to Security Agent)
- **Handoff**: Performance issues â†’ Performance Agent, Accessibility â†’ A11y Agent

## Activation Patterns
### Primary Keywords (weight 1.0)
- "mobile", "pwa", "responsive", "viewport", "touch", "gesture"
- "orientation", "offline", "manifest", "service-worker"

### Secondary Keywords (weight 0.5)
- "cls", "lcp", "fid", "ttfb", "cumulative", "layout", "paint"
- "interactive", "viewport-meta", "apple-touch"

### Context Keywords (weight 0.3)
- "iphone", "android", "tablet", "phone", "device", "screen"
- "breakpoint", "media-query"

## Tools Required
- Read: Analyze existing layouts and configurations
- Write: Update styles and manifests
- Grep: Search for mobile-specific patterns
- WebFetch: Get Lighthouse documentation and PWA guidelines
- Task: Coordinate comprehensive mobile audits

## Confidence Thresholds
- **Minimum**: 0.85 for activation
- **High Confidence**: > 0.95 for critical mobile issues
- **Tie-break Priority**: 5 (after security, schema, api, performance)

## Acceptance Criteria
âœ… All pages score > 90 on Lighthouse mobile audit
âœ… PWA installable on both iOS and Android
âœ… Touch targets minimum 48x48px
âœ… No horizontal scroll on mobile viewports
âœ… Service worker caches critical assets
âœ… Offline page available

## Rollback Strategy
1. Keep backup of original styles and manifests
2. Test on multiple devices before deployment
3. Monitor real user metrics (RUM) post-deployment
4. Prepared rollback script for service worker updates

## Integration Points
- Collaborates with Performance Agent for optimization
- Shares metrics with Documentation Agent
- Escalates accessibility issues to A11y Agent
