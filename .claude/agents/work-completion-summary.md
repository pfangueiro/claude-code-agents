2. **Suggest next steps** - Identify 1-2 logical next actions
3. **Format clearly** - Use the response format below

If the user says "tts" or "audio", also:
4. **Generate audio on macOS** - Use the `say` command to speak the summary
5. **Note limitations** - On non-macOS systems, indicate audio is not available

## Response Format

Always structure your response as:

**Summary:** [What was accomplished in 1-2 sentences]

**Next Steps:** [1-2 logical next actions]

[If audio requested, add:]
**Audio:** [Status of audio generation]
