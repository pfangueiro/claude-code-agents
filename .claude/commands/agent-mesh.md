# Agent Mesh Configuration

Configure and manage mesh communication between agents for direct agent-to-agent coordination, eliminating central bottlenecks and enabling advanced parallel execution patterns.

Parse the arguments to determine the mesh operation:
- "status" - Show current mesh configuration and agent connectivity
- "enable" - Enable mesh communication with optimal settings
- "disable" - Disable mesh, revert to file-based coordination
- "optimize" - Optimize mesh configuration for current workload
- "debug" - Enable mesh debugging and detailed logging

## Mesh Configuration Operations

### Enable Mesh Communication
1. **Setup Named Pipes (FIFOs)**
   - Create dedicated communication channels between agents
   - Configure secure inter-agent messaging
   - Implement message routing and discovery
   - Setup event-driven coordination system

2. **Configure Service Discovery**
   - Enable automatic agent discovery and registration
   - Setup agent capability broadcasting
   - Implement health-based routing
   - Configure load balancing across agent instances

3. **Optimize Communication Patterns**
   - Implement direct agent-to-agent messaging
   - Setup pub/sub event system for coordination
   - Configure parallel execution optimization
   - Enable real-time coordination and handoffs

### Mesh Status and Monitoring
1. **Connectivity Analysis**
   - Show agent-to-agent connectivity matrix
   - Display communication performance metrics
   - Monitor message throughput and latency
   - Analyze coordination efficiency

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Measure mesh communication performance
   - Compare mesh vs. file-based coordination speed
   - Track message delivery success rates
   - Monitor resource usage of mesh system

### Mesh Optimization
1. **Communication Optimization**
   - Optimize message routing for minimum latency
   - Implement intelligent load balancing
   - Configure optimal buffer sizes and timeouts
   - Tune communication protocols for efficiency

2. **Coordination Patterns**
   - Configure optimal parallel execution patterns
   - Setup intelligent agent selection and routing
   - Implement advanced workflow coordination
   - Enable predictive agent pre-allocation
