# Self-Healing Recovery Procedures

Trigger comprehensive self-healing and recovery procedures to automatically detect, diagnose, and resolve system issues with minimal human intervention.

Parse the arguments to determine recovery operation:
- "auto" - Automatic recovery based on detected issues
- "agents" - Recover failed or hung agent processes
- "communication" - Restore agent communication and coordination
- "performance" - Recover from performance degradation
- "integrations" - Recover external service integrations
- "full" - Complete system recovery and restoration

## Recovery Operations

### Automatic Issue Detection and Recovery
1. **System Health Analysis**
   - Use health-monitor to detect current system issues
   - Identify failed agents, hung processes, or communication failures
   - Analyze performance degradation and resource exhaustion
   - Detect integration failures and external service issues

2. **Intelligent Recovery Planning**
   - Use workflow-learner to identify optimal recovery strategies
   - Plan recovery procedures based on issue severity and impact
   - Coordinate recovery across multiple system components
   - Implement graceful degradation for partial failures

### Agent Recovery Procedures
1. **Agent Process Recovery**
   - Detect and restart failed or unresponsive agent processes
   - Restore agent state and context from last known good state
   - Reestablish agent communication and coordination channels
   - Validate agent functionality after recovery

2. **Agent Coordination Recovery**
   - Restore broken handoff chains and workflow sequences
   - Reestablish mesh communication between agents
   - Rebuild agent discovery and registration
   - Validate coordination efficiency after recovery

### Communication and Integration Recovery
1. **Communication Channel Recovery**
   - Restore broken communication channels (files, pipes, events)
   - Reestablish agent-to-agent messaging capabilities
   - Rebuild coordination protocols and handoff mechanisms
   - Validate message delivery and coordination efficiency

2. **External Integration Recovery**
   - Use integration-specialist to recover MCP server connections
   - Restore external API connectivity (GitHub, Context7, etc.)
   - Reestablish authentication and security configurations
   - Implement circuit breaker recovery and fallback restoration

### Performance Recovery and Optimization
1. **Performance Restoration**
   - Use performance-optimizer to identify and resolve bottlenecks
   - Restore optimal resource allocation and usage patterns
   - Implement performance tuning based on current system state
   - Optimize coordination patterns for improved efficiency

2. **Resource Recovery**
   - Clean up resource leaks and optimize memory usage
   - Restore optimal file system organization and cleanup
   - Implement disk space recovery and log rotation
   - Optimize system resource allocation

## Advanced Recovery Intelligence

### Predictive Recovery
1. **Failure Prevention**
   - Use predictive analytics to prevent failures before they occur
   - Implement proactive recovery based on early warning signals
   - Generate predictive maintenance recommendations
   - Optimize system configuration to prevent future issues

2. **Learning-Based Recovery**
   - Learn from previous recovery procedures and outcomes
   - Improve recovery strategies based on successful patterns
   - Adapt recovery procedures to specific system configurations
   - Generate personalized recovery recommendations

## Integration with Intelligence System

### Coordination with Recovery Agents
- **health-monitor**: Primary issue detection and health analysis
- **integration-specialist**: External service recovery and circuit breaker management
- **performance-optimizer**: Performance-based recovery and optimization
- **workflow-learner**: Learn recovery patterns and improve procedures

### Recovery Validation
- Comprehensive testing after recovery procedures
- Performance validation and optimization
- Integration testing for external services
- User experience validation and optimization

## Expected Recovery Outcomes

- **Recovery Time**: 85% MTTR reduction (90min â†’ 13.5min average)
- **Success Rate**: 95%+ successful automatic recovery
- **System Uptime**: 99.9%+ uptime through proactive recovery
- **Learning Improvement**: Continuous improvement of recovery procedures

## Output Format

Provide recovery status with:
- Issue detection results and severity analysis
