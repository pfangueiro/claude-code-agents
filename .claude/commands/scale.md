# Dynamic Agent Scaling

Manage dynamic scaling of agent instances based on workload, system resources, and performance requirements to achieve optimal throughput and efficiency.

Parse the arguments to determine scaling operation:
- "up [number]" - Scale up agent instances to specified number
- "down [number]" - Scale down agent instances safely
- "auto" - Enable automatic scaling based on workload
- "status" - Show current scaling status and capacity
- "optimize" - Optimize scaling configuration for current workload

## Scaling Operations

### Scale Up Operations
1. **Capacity Analysis**
   - Use health-monitor to assess current system capacity
   - Analyze resource availability (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Determine optimal number of additional agent instances
   - Plan resource allocation for new agent instances

2. **Agent Instance Management**
   - Create additional agent worker processes
   - Configure agent load balancing and work distribution
   - Setup agent discovery and registration
   - Implement health checks for new instances

3. **Performance Validation**
   - Validate scaling effectiveness through performance metrics
   - Monitor resource usage after scaling operations
   - Ensure no degradation in individual agent performance
   - Optimize coordination efficiency with increased capacity

### Scale Down Operations
1. **Safe Scaling Reduction**
   - Identify agents that can be safely terminated
   - Complete ongoing tasks before scaling down
   - Gracefully shutdown agent instances
   - Redistribute workload to remaining agents

2. **Resource Optimization**
   - Reclaim resources from terminated agent instances
   - Optimize remaining agent configuration
   - Adjust coordination patterns for reduced capacity
   - Maintain performance with fewer resources

### Automatic Scaling
1. **Workload-Based Scaling**
   - Monitor agent queue lengths and response times
   - Implement automatic scale-up triggers based on load
   - Configure scale-down triggers for resource optimization
   - Use predictive scaling based on historical patterns

2. **Resource-Aware Scaling**
   - Monitor system resource usage and availability
   - Scale based on CPU, memory, and I/O capacity
   - Implement intelligent resource allocation
   - Prevent resource exhaustion through proactive scaling

## Integration with Intelligence System

### Coordination with Scaling Agents
- **health-monitor**: Monitor system capacity and performance
- **performance-optimizer**: Optimize performance at scale
- **ai-optimizer**: Cost-aware scaling decisions
- **workflow-learner**: Learn optimal scaling patterns

### Scaling Intelligence
- Learn optimal scaling patterns from historical data
- Predict scaling needs based on project type and workload
- Optimize cost vs. performance trade-offs at scale
- Implement intelligent scaling policies

## Expected Scaling Outcomes

- **Throughput**: Support 500+ concurrent agents (vs. current 10)
- **Efficiency**: Optimal resource utilization through intelligent scaling
- **Cost Optimization**: Scale resources based on actual demand
- **Performance**: Maintain optimal performance across all scaling levels

## Output Format

Provide scaling status with:
- Current agent instance count and capacity
- Resource usage and availability analysis
- Scaling recommendations and optimal configuration
- Performance impact analysis of scaling operations
- Cost implications of scaling decisions
- Automatic scaling configuration and triggers

Coordinate scaling operations with monitoring and optimization agents to achieve optimal system capacity and performance.
