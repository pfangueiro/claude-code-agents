# Predictive Analytics and Forecasting

Generate comprehensive forecasts for system performance, costs, resource needs, and optimization opportunities based on historical data and current trends.

Parse the arguments to determine forecast type:
- "costs [timeframe]" - Forecast token usage and costs
- "performance [timeframe]" - Predict performance trends and bottlenecks
- "workload [timeframe]" - Forecast agent workload and capacity needs
- "optimization [timeframe]" - Predict optimization opportunities
- "all [timeframe]" - Comprehensive forecasting across all areas

## Forecasting Operations

### Cost Forecasting and Prediction
