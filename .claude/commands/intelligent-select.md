# Intelligent Agent Selection

Advanced agent selection system that uses AI analysis, context awareness, and learned patterns to optimally select and coordinate agents for complex tasks.

Parse the arguments to determine selection operation:
- "analyze [task]" - Analyze task and recommend optimal agents
- "score [task]" - Score all agents for given task with confidence levels
- "optimize [task]" - Select and optimize agent combination for maximum efficiency
- "learn [task]" - Learn from task to improve future selections
- "predict [task]" - Predict optimal agents based on historical patterns

## Intelligent Selection Operations

### Task Analysis and Agent Scoring
1. **Comprehensive Task Analysis**
   - Use context-analyzer to understand task requirements and context
   - Analyze task complexity, scope, and technical requirements
   - Identify required skills, tools, and expertise areas
   - Consider project context, tech stack, and current development stage

2. **Agent Relevance Scoring**
   - Score each agent's relevance for the specific task
   - Consider agent expertise, tools, and model capabilities
   - Analyze historical success rates for similar tasks
   - Generate confidence scores for agent selection recommendations

### Multi-Agent Coordination Intelligence
1. **Optimal Agent Combination Selection**
   - Identify tasks requiring multiple agents and optimal combinations
   - Plan parallel vs. sequential execution based on task dependencies
