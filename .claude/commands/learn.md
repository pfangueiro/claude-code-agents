# Learn from Patterns

Force the system to learn from current conversation patterns, user interactions, and workflow executions to improve future agent selection and coordination.

Parse the arguments to determine learning operation:
- "analyze" - Analyze current conversation for learning opportunities
- "patterns" - Extract and learn from successful workflow patterns
- "preferences" - Learn user preferences from interaction history
- "optimize" - Apply learned patterns to optimize current configuration
- "reset" - Reset learning data and start fresh

## Learning Operations

### Pattern Analysis and Extraction
1. **Conversation Analysis**
   - Use workflow-learner agent to analyze current conversation
   - Extract successful agent activation patterns
   - Identify user intent and preferred workflow sequences
   - Learn from successful task completions and handoffs

2. **Workflow Pattern Learning**
   - Analyze historical agent coordination sequences
   - Identify most effective agent combinations
   - Learn optimal timing for agent activation and handoffs
   - Extract successful parallel execution patterns

3. **User Preference Learning**
   - Analyze user language patterns and preferences
   - Learn preferred agent activation styles
   - Identify successful cost vs. performance trade-offs
   - Extract personalized workflow preferences

### Learning Application and Optimization
1. **Agent Selection Optimization**
   - Apply learned patterns to improve agent selection accuracy
   - Optimize activation scoring based on successful outcomes
   - Improve conflict resolution when multiple agents match
   - Enhance context-aware agent selection intelligence

2. **Workflow Optimization**
   - Apply learned patterns to optimize workflow sequences
   - Improve handoff efficiency based on successful patterns
   - Optimize parallel execution based on learned coordination
   - Enhance quality gate timing and effectiveness

3. **Cost and Performance Learning**
   - Apply learned patterns to optimize model selection
   - Improve cost prediction accuracy based on historical data
   - Optimize resource allocation based on learned usage patterns
