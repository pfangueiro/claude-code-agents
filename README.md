**One command. Zero config. Just works.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

- **70% Cost Savings** - Automatically uses cheapest model that can handle each task
- **Zero Setup** - Works immediately, no configuration needed
- **4 Specialized Agents** - Each optimized for specific tasks
- **Smart Detection** - 100+ technical keywords recognized
- **Minimal Footprint** - Only 12 files, 30KB total
- **Project Aware** - Auto-detects your tech stack

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (10 seconds)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pfangueiro/claude-code-agents/main/install.sh | bash

# 2. Check recommendation (optional)
.claude/router.sh "Create a REST API"
# Output: Architect [S] - Using Sonnet ($3/1M)

# 3. Use Claude normally
claude> Create a REST API with user authentication
```

## What Is This?

A lightweight agent system that:
- **Automatically selects the cheapest AI model** that can handle your task
- **Provides specialized context** to Claude for better results
- **Tracks costs and usage** to optimize over time
- **Works with existing projects** without breaking anything

## How It Works

### 1. Smart Model Selection
The router analyzes your request and chooses:
- **Haiku ($0.80/1M)** - For simple tasks, documentation, basic operations
- **Sonnet ($3/1M)** - For standard development, debugging, integration
- **Opus ($15/1M)** - Only for complex architecture, critical bugs, deep analysis

### 2. Agent Specialization
Four focused agents handle all tasks:
- **Architect** - Builds and designs code
- **Guardian** - Fixes, tests, and secures
- **Connector** - Deploys and integrates
- **Documenter** - Explains and documents

### 3. Usage Pattern
```bash
# OPTIONAL: Preview which agent/model would be used
.claude/router.sh "Create a REST API"
# Output: Architect [S] - Sonnet recommended ($3/1M)

# MAIN: Just use Claude CLI normally
claude> Create a REST API for user management
# Claude automatically uses the optimal agent context
```

### Special Keywords

Use these trigger words to activate special modes:

| Keyword | Effect | Indicator | Model Override |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **ULTRATHINK** | Deep analysis mode | [ULTRATHINK] in magenta | Forces Opus ($15/1M) |
| **CRITICAL** | Maximum priority | [CRITICAL] in red | Forces Opus ($15/1M) |
| **FAST** | Speed optimized | [FAST] in green | Forces Haiku ($0.80/1M) |
| **REVIEW** | Thorough analysis | [REVIEW] in blue | Guardian + Opus |

```bash
# Examples:
.claude/router.sh "ULTRATHINK about the architecture"
.claude/router.sh "CRITICAL production bug"
.claude/router.sh "FAST prototype this feature"
.claude/router.sh "REVIEW code for security issues"
```

**Note**: The router.sh is a **planning tool** that shows you which agent/model would be optimal. The actual AI work happens in your Claude CLI session.

## The 4 Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Keywords | Model Strategy |
|-------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Architect** | Builds & designs code | create, build, implement, design, API, component, feature | Sonnet default, Opus for complex systems |
| **Guardian** | Quality & security | test, fix, secure, optimize, bug, error, performance | Sonnet default, Opus for critical issues |
| **Connector** | Integrations & deployment | deploy, integrate, connect, AWS, Docker, CI/CD | Haiku default, Sonnet for production |
| **Documenter** | Documentation | document, explain, describe, comment, README | Always Haiku (95% cost savings) |

## Real-World Examples

### Building a Feature (Architect â†’ Sonnet)
```bash
# Router analysis
.claude/router.sh "Create user authentication with JWT"
# â†’ Architect [S] $0.003/1K tokens

# In Claude CLI
claude> Create user authentication with JWT
# Builds complete auth system with optimal model
```

### Fixing Production Bug (Guardian â†’ Opus)
```bash
# Router analysis
.claude/router.sh "CRITICAL memory leak in production"
# â†’ [CRITICAL] Guardian [O] $0.015/1K tokens

# In Claude CLI
claude> Fix the critical memory leak in production
# Uses maximum intelligence for critical issue
```

### Quick Documentation (Documenter â†’ Haiku)
```bash
# Router analysis
.claude/router.sh "Document this API"
# â†’ Documenter [H] $0.0008/1K tokens (95% savings!)

# In Claude CLI
claude> Document this API with examples
# Generates docs with cheapest model
```

## Project Structure

After installation, you get:
```
your-project/
â””â”€â”€ .claude/
    â”œâ”€â”€ agents/      # The 4 AI agents with model configs
    â”œâ”€â”€ router.sh    # Smart router with complexity detection
    â””â”€â”€ history/     # Learns patterns and tracks costs
```

**Smart Features**:
- **Automatic model selection**: Saves 70% on API costs
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded agents with emojis
- **Cost tracking**: See exactly what each request costs
- **Complexity detection**: Uses expensive models only when needed

## For Different Projects

The system auto-detects your project type and adapts:

- **Node.js/React**: Focuses on components and APIs
- **Python/Django**: Emphasizes backend and data
- **Mobile**: Optimizes for app development
- **New Project**: Helps you start from scratch

â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
Model usage distribution:
  Haiku:  45 requests (60%)
  Sonnet: 25 requests (33%)
  Opus:   5 requests (7%)

Estimated savings: 70% vs all-Opus usage
```

## Deployment Options

- **Local Development**: Installs in current directory
- **CI/CD**: Add to GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Docker**: Include in Dockerfile
- **Cloud IDE**: Works in Codespaces, Replit, Gitpod
- **Enterprise**: Deploy as MCP server for central management

## Troubleshooting

**"How do I use this?"**
â†’ Just use Claude CLI normally. The agents provide context automatically.

**"What does router.sh do?"**
â†’ It's a planning tool that shows which agent/model would be optimal. Run: `.claude/router.sh "your task"`

**"Check system status"**
â†’ Run: `.claude/router.sh status`

**"View cost analysis"**
â†’ Run: `.claude/router.sh costs`

**"See request history"**
â†’ Run: `.claude/router.sh history`

**"Wrong agent recommended?"**
â†’ Be more specific in your request description

## Uninstall

```bash
rm -rf .claude
```
